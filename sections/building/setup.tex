The setup used is the crops/poky docker container\cite{crops-poky} as the current build host OS is
not suitable for building yocto images and using docker image saves the headache it can be to
setup a cross-compilation toolchain correctly.
It would be more preferable to have a native build host, as that can make bitbake recipes
that makes use of libraries of the build host easier to manage.

At the time of the project start mender 2.2 was the latest stable release and therefore it
is the one being used.
The latest yocto version that mender supports is 2.7.3, codename warrior.
The latest yocto release is 3.1(dunfell), but looking through the
OpenEmbedded layer index\cite{oe-index}
it can be seen that a lot of layers have yet to be made compliant with yocto 3.X, so it does not
seem to be a sign of staleness on menders part.

A git repository has been made with the correct version of all layers needed for this project and
can be found on github\cite{yocto-build}.
