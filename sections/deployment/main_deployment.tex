\subsection{Provisioning a new device}%
\label{sub:provisioning_a_new_device}
Assuming rpi3b+ as to always just run PXE boot. Though if using an older rpi unit use 
\mintinline{bash}{bootbin.sh} to setup an sdcard up with the bootcode.bin file which
enables older rpis to PXE boot.

The PXE boot server is hosted on a raspberrypi.
A new device will boot a default raspbian buster image which mounts an NFS share
from the development host which have the current sdcard image that 
should be deployed. On the same share there is a script, \mintinline{bash}{boot.sh}, which is
run using a cron job during startup.
This is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:boot-process}.\\

When a device boots the mender image for the first time it will show up as pending on the mender
host interface as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:mender-ui-pending}.
Here it can be accepted as an authorized device.
This is under the assumption that local network on which the developer host attached is secure.

\subsection{Updating existing device}%
\label{sub:updating_existing_device}

Updating a device is taken of by the mender server. When compiling a sdcard image using yocto,
a mender artefact is also generated, this can be uploaded to the mender server.
The artefact can then be assigned devices or groups, where any device in an assigned group will
receive the update the next time the deployed device polls the mender server.\\

To ensure robustness mender makes use of what they call an A/B rootfs.
Of rootfs A is version 1.0 adn B is 2.0, then B is in use if it has been committed.
Then if the device updated A will be overridden to the new version and the deployed device will
try to commit the new rootfs.

An overview of the possible states a mender client can be in, is shown on
figure \ref{fig:mender-states}.
A mender artifact can both be a update for a mender update module or a rootfs update.
With this system mender can deliver robust and reliable updates for deployed devices.

\end{figure}

This system with states also allow for great customizability when creating update modules.



\subsection{Tasks}%
\label{sub:tasks}

Tasks are deployed using the mender update module and deploying a task have been made idempotent
to insure that a device will not try to execute the same task twice over.

A mender update module is an executable located in \texttt{/usr/share/mender/modules/v3}
which takes 2 arguments, state and files.

Under the assumption that any needed program is existing on the deployed device,
an update module is made that adds tasks as cron jobs.

This approach is chosen as cron has been around for many years, and is available on most
Linux systems.
Cron jobs also have a simple syntax, making it easier to maintain currently scheduled tasks.

It is also simple to schedule jobs for different users as the cron service looks in
\mintinline{bash}{/var/spool/cron/} for files with the name of the user it should execute as.
Making this solution compliant with the requirements in section \ref{sub:requirements}.

This update module is implemented in bash for ease of readability and maintainability, but could
be implemented in C, if the footprint of the update module was a greater concern and is publicly
available on github\cite{mclurs-update-module}.

An update for this module can be created like this\cite{mender-artefact}: 
\begin{minted}[frame=none]{bash}
mender-artifact write module-image -t $DEVICE_TYPE -T mclurs -f <CRON_FILE1> -f <CRON_FILE2>
\end{minted}

\begin{listing}[h]
\begin{minted}[bgcolor=white!0]{json}
{
	"id": "5ed373e8bacd430001464145",
	"attributes": [
		{ "..." }, {
			"name": "cron_user2",
			"value": "1 0 1 * * echo 'Hello new month'%10,1 0 * * * echo 'Hello new day%10"
		}, {
			"name": "cron_user1",
			"value": "1 0 1 * * echo 'Hello new month'%10,1 0 * * * echo 'Hello new day%10"
		}, { "..." }
	],
  "updated_ts": "2020-05-31T14:42:09.02Z"
}
\end{minted}
\caption{Mender device inventory with list of current cronjobs in JSON format.}
\label{lst:inv-cron-json}
\end{listing}

Tasks are visible in the mender inventory as shown in listing \ref{lst:inv-cron-json}.


\subsection{Docker}%
\label{sub:docker}

Instead of porting projects mender already has a docker update module. This of course reduce
the requirement for porting software at the expense of greater overhead, connected with running
containers.

The custom kernel module is still needed on the deployed device, but other than that it only needs
the docker service.

A mclurs docker file can be seen in listing \ref{lst:mclurs-docker}.

\begin{listing}[h]
\inputminted{docker}{/home/aske/Bachelor/DockerMCLURS/Dockerfile}
\caption{A docker file that enables the MCLURS project to run in a dockerdocker  container.}
\label{lst:mclurs-docker}
\end{listing}

The docker container can then be build and pushed to dockerhub.
A mender artifact can then be generated as shown in listing \ref{lst:docker-mender-push}.
The artefact can be uploaded the mender server and from there a deployment can be created
to any device matching \mintinline{bash}|${DEVICE_TYPE}|.

\begin{listing}[h]
\begin{minted}{bash}
docker build . -t mclurs
docker push ${ID}/${REPO}:mclurs
docker-artifact-gen -n ${ARTIFACT_NAME} -t ${DEVICE_TYPE} -o ${OUTPUT_PATH} ${DOCKER_IMAGES}
\end{minted}
\caption{Generate mender artefact for the docker mender update module.}

\end{listing}
