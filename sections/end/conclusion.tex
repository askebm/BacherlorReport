An IoT edge cloud solution for Linux embedded device is presented in this project.
It is should be feasible for any embedded software developer to migrate a project to the yocto
project.
The solution does not incur the smallest maintenance penalty, but it does move the critical 
maintenance points to a large open-source community.\\

It also eases any future expansion to other embedded devices, conserving the same workflow across
multiple hardware platforms.
