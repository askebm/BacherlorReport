	\bf\large Abstract
\end{center}

This project aims to determine the feasibility of implementing an IoT like workflow for deploying
sandboxed applications to the MCLURS system developed by SDU.
\todo{Objective}
\\

This is done by looking at existing IoT solutions mender and pantahub and attempting to migrate
the MCLURS project.
\todo{Method}
\\

Mender is a viable IoT solution for Linux embedded devices, with create emphasis on robustness
and security.
\todo{Result}
\\

As some libraries could not be made functioning under the openembedded layer scheme
there  is a time penalty to migrating to yocto, but as mender supports converting debian images
there is a opportunity for a multi step migration process.
\todo{Summary of Discussion}
