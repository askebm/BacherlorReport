\end{center}

This project aims to determine the feasibility of implementing an IoT like workflow for deploying
sandboxed applications to the MCLURS system developed by SDU.\\
This is done by looking at existing IoT solutions mender and pantahub and attempting to migrate
the MCLURS project.\\
Mender is a viable IoT solution for Linux embedded devices, with create emphasis on robustness
and security.\\
As some libraries could not be made functioning under the OpenEmbedded layer scheme
there  is a time penalty to migrating to yocto, but as mender supports converting debian images
there is a opportunity for a multi step migration process.
