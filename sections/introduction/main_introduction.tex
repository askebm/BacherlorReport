As this prject aims to implement an IoT like workflow, for deploying sandboxed applications
on Linux embedded devices \todo{We}, we start by looking at existing solutions that might
facilitate this kind of workflow.\\

Afterwards we look at what extra features one these services provide which could improve
the maintainability/longevity/flexibility of the workflow.
Here we go through how to build an image, updating existing devices and provisioning a new
device.\\

Afterwards we go through how to deploy a task to a device\\

Lastly we explore which attack vectors to secure against and how we do so.
