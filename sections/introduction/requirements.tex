\begin{itemize}
	\item It should be possible to deploy an application to a specific PI in the field.
	\item It should be possible to re-deploy to a specific PI in the field.
	\item It should be possible to deploy an application and run the PI in the field, offline
	\item It should be possible to get the log from the PI while it’s in the field (and is online)
	\item There should be a built-in mechanism that handles software failure (rolls back to the last working version)
	\item The solutions must be able to handle a custom kernel (as it needs to support the custom kernel module made by John)
	\item The applications must be able to talk with the hardware (I2C, DAC etc.)
	\item Deploying the initial image/stub/whatever to a PI must be fast, easy and as automatic as possible (PXE boot, etc.)
	\item Registering/discovering the new PI must be fast, easy and possible to automate.
	\item The system must handle different namespaces/accounts/groups in order to be able to handle multiple projects with different project owners.
	\item The solution must not rely on being able to SSH/contact the PI directly - all communication with the PI must happen through a web interface.
	\item All configuration for a certain application(s) must not rely on custom config of the stub/host-image - all configuration should be included in the container/image. (kernel modules are an exception to this)
	\item Persistent data (sound recordings) should be saved on an external harddrive (outside the container)
	\item Security must be part of the solutions design, so the PIs can’t be used as botnet, mining, etc.
