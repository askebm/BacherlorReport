	%Mender
			Can be created from default debian images, so its less intrusive to
			existing workflow
			Images as a result of this is huge (requires 8 GB)
			https://docs.mender.io/2.2/getting-started/quickstart-with-raspberry-pi
			support Yocto as part of their layers, which should reduce image footprint
			Will require a new workflow, toolchain, etc.
			Huge community in both Yocto and Mender

	&%Pantehub
